You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
location = 'Jl. Restu, Helvetia Tim., Kec. Medan Helvetia, Kota Medan, Sumatera Utara 20124'
street2coordinates(location)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
